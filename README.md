# todo-app

This project is called to-do very creative i know

This is a to do list website where you can input tasks, and set the date when it's due.
If the date you inputted is before today's date then it will throw an error and tell you that was invalid!

It'll save it using the local storage I made this project because i downloaded a to do list app on my phone and wanted to replicate it, ended up liking the more simplified version of this website and tadah!
We have to-do! And it's free unfortutanetly with no ability to change your background into something more aesthetically pleasing, which may be added.

When i made this i was just learning how to use Arrays in javascript and data saving it was a steep learning curve with a self imposed deadline, but documentation was a great tool for me.

Input your task, change the priority flag using the emojis popups and you have a task for the future or today.
